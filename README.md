In today's world, there is an increasingðŸ“ˆneed for sustainable solutions to reduce the textile waste and minimize the use of plastic covers among small shops.
Traditional plastic bags contribute significantly to pollution and waste, posing a severe threat to our planet. Meanwhile, a large amount of old and unused
cloth goes to waste, and many low-level or fresher tailors struggle to find opportunities to showcase their skills and generate income.

The challenge is to create a sustainable marketplace that connects:
1. Old and unused cloth vendors who have surplus materials.
2. Low-level or fresher tailors who can repurpose these materials into reusable cloth bags.
3. Small shopkeepers who are interested in using cloth bags as an alternative to plastic, aligning with sustainable practices and local regulations.
   
By bridging these groups, the web app will promote a circular economy, reduce textile waste, support local artisans, and help small businesses adopt ecofriendly alternatives.
This platform will empower communities to engage in sustainable practices while fostering a network that benefits everyone involvedðŸ¤—
